### Wireframe and Design

### Mozilla HTML Basics

* HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
* HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
* The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
* If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags.
* The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
* Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things.
